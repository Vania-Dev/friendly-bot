# Project Title: Text Agent

## Overview
The Text Agent is an open-source Python project designed to build conversational AI models using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The primary goal of the project is to create a flexible and efficient framework for developing text-based agents that can understand and respond to user inputs. This project aims to provide a solid foundation for building advanced NLP applications, including chatbots, sentiment analysis, and more.

## Installation Instructions

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Install required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Install additional dependencies specified in `uv.lock` using `yarn install`.

Optional dependencies can be installed separately.

```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install additional dependencies (if necessary)
yarn install
```

## File Descriptions

*   `requirements.txt`: A list of required packages and libraries for the project.
*   `pyproject.toml`: A configuration file that defines metadata, build instructions, and other project settings.
*   `main.py`: The main entry point of the project, responsible for running the Text Agent application.
*   `Agents/text_agent.py`: The core module for building text-based agents, including NLP processing and response generation.
*   `Agents/prompt_config.py`: A configuration file for customizing prompt templates and other agent settings.
*   `Agents/__init__.py`: An empty module that serves as a placeholder for future feature additions.

## Usage Instructions

To run the project, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py --help
```

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [project documentation](#project-documentation).

## Project Documentation

### Running the Application

To start the Text Agent application, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --agent text_agent --prompt <prompt-template>
```

Replace `<prompt-template>` with a valid prompt template from `Agents/prompt_config.py`.

### Development Workflow

1.  Clone the repository using Git: `git clone https://github.com/username/text-agent.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd text-agent`
3.  Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  Create changes in your preferred code editor or IDE.
5.  Commit changes with meaningful commit messages.
6.  Push changes to your remote repository.
